Hitting shift while having an item selected will display an image of the meal through QuickLook, or maybe just a placeholder if no image is available.

### Download

Just head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kiliankoe/alfred_mensa/releases/latest).

### Customization

There's two settings you can change from within Alfred. Select the workflow in the Alfred settings and click on `[𝒙]` in the upper right-hand corner. There you can edit the default canteen which is shown if you only enter "mensa". You can also list meals at other canteens by just typing e.g. "mensa siedepunkt".

The other setting lets you choose which price to display. Default is the student price, but by changing that you can have the employee price displayed instead.
